							<h2>Godzilla</h2>
							<p>
								As a wee-lad growing up, obviously dinosaurs were awesome.
								Playing with plastic toy dinosaurs and cars to pass the time, it gives you
								a deep imagination. Then all of the sudden thrusted upon you, a legendary monster.
								It has atomic breath, spines in it's back, design wise he is goregous.
								Your child mind can't handle it, but at first Godzilla is a villian.
								You're told to hate Godzilla, despite how super cool he is.
							</p>
							<p>A year goes by, and bam, the monster you're told to hate, but secretely idolized is suddenly fighting
								other monsters. He's the hero... he always was in your heart. What a time to be alive.

							<h2>It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia</h2>
							<p>
								When it comes time to watch a show you want something that intrigues you. You want it to do a 
								lot for you because it's what you're choosing to waste your time in the day. So many shows use the same 
								old tired formula that you practically already seen the entire show before even watching it.
								Breaking from this formula, while not ground breaking is what makes Sunny feel so fresh.
								It truly is a wild card show. Because the gang is made up of “bad people” &amp the only thing you really
								expect is for the gang to fail. How they fail is usually what's so funny about the show.
							</p>

							<p>
								Though out of all of this Danny Devito is an amazing character in the show, and some of his
								life work shows that he's also a great person. He gives his all in his performance because
								his children love the show.

					<p id = "notCheckingOfBoxes2">
						My dad loved western movies, that and movies like "Platoon", which is another movie I could of added to this list.
						Though I like to keep things simple. This movie is great, it has action out the wazoo and the story teling to match.
						It has famous scene where Val Kilmer's character Doc Holiday says, "I'm your huckleberry". The way he says it and how 
						shocked Johnny Ringo is after hearing it come from Doc Holiday, is cinema gold.

					<h2>Dave</h2>
					<p>
						Dave is a show following the life a comedic-rapper and his rise to fame. Season one was a bit 
						difficult to watch because it was success after success that it made it seem like it was more about
						inflating Dave's ego. He sufferes a few defeats, but in the end you really want to see where the show is growing
						The show is a bit cringe, but it does hook you with good music, funny sitituations and feel good moments.

					<h2>Rick And Morty</h2>
					<p>
						Rick and Morty is a cartoon created by Dan Harman and Justin Roland. The show follows a 
						son and his grandpa as they go on zanny adventures across the universe and multiverse. You never really know where Rick 
						and Morty are going to end up next. That's a good part of the show though. Showing how they aren't tied 
						down to our reality and any episode can wide up in any space, not time though. They don't do time travel.

					<h2>Eastbound And Down</h2>
					<p>
						Eastbound And Down, not the song, but the T.V. show is about Kenny Powers (Danny McBride) fall 
						from grace. His destructive behavior and lack of respect for others lead to powerful confrontations. 
						This puts Kenny in deeper and deeper problems, but the glory is watching him crawl out of the mess he made 
						for himself. It's hard not to enjoy this series, because it's big laughs after big laughs.
					</p>

					<h2>What We Do In The Shadows</h2>
					<p>
						What We Do In The Shadows is a mockumentary following a group of vampires. The show is downright hilarious, the whole 
						cast is charming. You actually want to see nothing bad happen to them, but they aren't "good people". They still are blood 
						thirsty monsters who have to sustain themselves. None the less it is an amazing show worth watching. You can't go wrong with 
						a night of What We Do In The Shadows.

					<a name = "workaholics"></a>
					<h2>Workaholics</h2>
					<p>
						WorkaHolics really cements its home in my heart. It's a show about slackers, slacking off. 
						This premise has to resonate with the vast majority of the workforce. I worked with these types of people, I've been these 
						type of people. It's so relatiable. Another show with over the top hijinks while telling your boss off.
					</p>

				<section>
					<a name = "bojack"></a>
					<h2>Bojack Horseman</h2>
					<p>
						Bojack Horseman is a serious comedy about dramatic things. The show past season one is consider by most 
						a masterpiece. It takes on tough to talk about topics and can handle them because the show is setup like a sitcom 
						but navigates it as a cartoon. It can be silly in exteremly dramatic moments because the show to alter it's tones with 
						gags. It is breath of fresh air, at the same time can be stifling because the tone is dark.
					</p>

					<a name = "letterkenny"></a>
					<h2>Letterkenny</h2>
					<p>
						Letterkenny is my ultimate feel good show, when I just want to see my heroes succeed. The only problem is, while the main 
						character is solid emotionally, nearly every terrible thing happens to him. Though we get to watch as navigates through the problems 
						with a heavy shrug from his stern shoulders and push on. Because chores need a doing and someong gots to do em'. Letterkenny sets up 
						the premise that character matters, not the character, but you. The person, and what your character is. That matters more than 
						what you do, because what you do is generally what your character would do. It defines you and how you act. That's a major 
						turning point in lifestyles.
